===============================

A replacement for the default chat system that makes it behave more like voices.
That means you can only see the messages of other players if you're in a certain
range to them. If you move out of this range, you might only get part of
the messages, or nothing at all.


How does it work?
=================

There are basically three "volumes" a player can say something in, talk, shout
and whisper. Shout reaches obviously the farthest, followed by talk and whisper.

If you want to "hear" a player, you need to be in a certain range to them,
otherwise you might only get part of what was said or nothing at all.
Additionally, if you can't see the player, the range is further limited, that
means that a wall will severly impact if you're able to hear a player or not.

By default a player only talks, that means that every normal chat message
is converted. Additionally there are the following commands avaialble:

    /t or /talk     Talk, medium range. Is default for messages.
    /w or /whisper  Whisper, low range.
    /s or /shout    Shout, high range.
    /g or /global   Global, needs voice_global privilege

There is no global chat anymore as long as voice is activated.


How to use it?
==============

Simple, just add this to your `init.lua`, or wherever the main initialization
of your stuff happens. Of course don't forget to add voice as depdency.

    voice.activate()


Callbacks
=========

You can register callbacks for every send message in which you can either
suppress or modify it. The signature for the callbacks is:

    function(
        player,     -- The Player object of the player that is sending
                    -- the message.
        type,       -- The type of the message, one of the voice.TYPE_*
                    -- constants.
        suppressed, -- If the message would be suppressed.
        message)    -- The message itself.
    
    returns
        suppress,   -- true if the message should be suppressed.
                    -- nil to keep the current status.
        message     -- The message that should be send instead.
                    -- nil to keep the current message.

Some examples:

    -- This callback suppresses all shouts.
    voice.register_on_message(function(player, type, suppressed, message)
        return (type == voice.TYPE_SHOUT)
    end)
    
    -- This callback sends a completely different message.
    voice.register_on_message(function(player, type, suppressed, message)
        return false, "Hello there!"
    end)
   

The callbacks are called in the order they have been registered, the last
callback is the one that can decide whether the message is actually send or
suppressed. If the message is is modified, the modified message is handed
to all callbacks that follow.
