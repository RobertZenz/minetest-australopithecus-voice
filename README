===============================

A replacement for the default chat system that makes it behave more like voices.
That means you can only see the messages of other players if you're in a certain
range to them. If you move out of this range, you might only get part of
the messages, or nothing at all.


How does it work?
=================

There are basically three "volumes" a player can say something in, talk, shout
and whisper. Shout reaches obviously the farthest, followed by talk and whisper.

If you want to "hear" a player, you need to be in a certain range to them,
otherwise you might only get part of what was said or nothing at all.
Additionally, if you can't see the player, the range is further limited, that
means that a wall will severly impact if you're able to hear a player or not.

By default a player only talks, that means that every normal chat message
is converted. Additionally there are the following commands avaialble:

    /t or /talk		Talk, medium range. Is default for messages.
    /w or /whisper	Whisper, low range.
    /s or /shout	Shout, high range.

There is no global chat anymore as long as voice is activated.


How to use it?
==============

Simple, just add this to your `init.lua`, or wherever the main initialization
of your stuff happens. Of course don't forget to add voice as depdency.

    voice.activate()
